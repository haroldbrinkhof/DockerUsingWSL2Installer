# DockerUsingWSL2Installer
installer script for docker on windows using only WSL2 through bash and powershell

just a simple script that installs Ubuntu-20.04 under windows wsl2, installs docker in it and adds the necessary aliases and powershell functions to use it. 

(basically docker on windows without docker desktop)

executed via ./installDockerUsingWSL2.sh
if you need it to use a proxy, edit proxySettings.sh
