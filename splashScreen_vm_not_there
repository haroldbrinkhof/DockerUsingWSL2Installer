We will now start to install the Ubuntu-20.04 WSL distribution

You will see a new screen popup, this screen will ask you for
- username: put in "docker<enter>"
- password: put in "docker<enter>"
- confirmation of password: put in "docker<enter>"

next the vm will start a shell and show you some statistics, once you can, just
put in "exit<enter>" to quit this WSL shell and return to this window 
to continue the configuration of the distribution that just got installed.

so (all follwed by <enter> key):

docker
docker
docker
exit


see you soon. Tap <enter> now to start the installation.
